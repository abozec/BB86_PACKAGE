src_2.0.01_16/TEST/README.src.test:

This directory contains stand-alone tests of MPI communication routines.
It should not normally be needed to run HYCOM, unless there are 
indications that the MPI version is not working correctly (e.g. a failed 
named pipe comparison, see README.expt_pipe).  Note that the ATLa2.00
coastline is not a definative test of MPI communications, but these 
test cases have also been run on several other regions.

To create all the executables issue the command:

    ./Make_all.com >$ Make_all.log

This assumes that ../hycom is up to date, and that compiled module 
information is either in *.o or *.mod.  Edit Make_all.com for the
appropriate ARCH.  Note that the TYPE is taken from the source 
directory name.

All the run scripts are configured for an IBM SP with the LoadLeveler 
batch system, with either 3 or 9 MPI tasks.  These should be edited
for your region and the appropriate number of MPI tasks.

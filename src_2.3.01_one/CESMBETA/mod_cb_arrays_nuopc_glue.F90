      module mod_cb_arrays_nuopc_glue
      
        ! The purpose of this module is to make select common block entities
        ! available as public module variables. Doing this through an extra
        ! Fortran module is cleaner than simply including the entyre common
        ! blocks header in the actual glue module. Further, the common blocks
        ! header is in fixed format, and that means that which ever unit pulls
        ! it in via include also needs to be in fixed format... not something
        ! that would be nice for the actual hycom_nuopc_glue module.
